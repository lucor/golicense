# lian

lian is a license analyzer for Go binaries and modules. 

It aims to help in the following use cases:

- report all the dependencies, their versions, and licenses type along with the URL on pkg.go.dev
- dump and combine all licenses to comply with package distribution
- check against a set of allowed licenses

## Example

`lian` in action with itself

<div align="center">
    <img alt="lian example" src="example.gif" />
</div>

## How it works

It is designed to work without connecting to third-party services.

The licenses are detected using the
[google/licensecheck](https://github.com/google/licensecheck) library that will scans
source texts for known licenses directly from the [module cache](https://go.dev/ref/mod#module-cache).

The module cache usually is already warmed if the module has been already built locally.
If the dependencies are not present the `-d, --download` option can be specified and it will automatically download the dependencies using the `go mod download` command.

## Installation

```
$ go install lucor.dev/lian@latest
```

Note: requires Go >= 1.18

## Download

Pre-built binaries can be downloaded from the [releases](https://lucor.dev/lian/releases) page

```

### License check for a Go module

```
lian --allowed "MIT,BSD-3-CLAUSE" /path/to/go.mod
```

### Dump all licenses to a file for a Go binary

```
lian --dump -o LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY /path/to/go_binary
```

### License check as GitHub action

```yml
name: License check
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: actions/setup-go@v2
      with:
        stable: 'false'
        go-version: '1.18.0-beta2'

    - name: install lian
      run: go install lucor.dev/lian@latest

    - name: license check against go.mod
      run: lian -d --allowed="BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, MIT"

    - name: build
      run: go build

    - name: License check against the Go binary
      run: lian --allowed="BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, MIT" ./lian
```
